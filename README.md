# R_programming_project_Movie_Recommendation_System

A movie recommendation system is a type of software application or algorithm that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, or other relevant factors.
The primary goal of a movie recommendation system is to enhance user experience by providing personalized and relevant movie suggestions.
I have used Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) in my project which : -
Recommends movies to a user based on the similarity between the movies they have liked or rated.
If a user liked a particular movie, the system recommends other movies that are similar to it.
I have used 2 data sets one contains the movies data and the other with some ratings.
I have also itegrated my R model With Shiny UI application to create a web application.
